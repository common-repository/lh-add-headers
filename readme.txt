Adds the ETag, Last-Modified, and if appropriate 304 headers to HTTP responses generated by WordPress for more efficient caching.


== Description ==

A `304 Not Modified HTTP Header` tells your visitors that nothing has changed since their last visit. This is important as without this header visitors may be downloading your webpages from scratch each time, slowing down their experience and your site.

Generally if you do not pass `304 Not Modified HTTP Header` through your HTTP header, crawlers will fetch your whole website and then compare the content of your site with the already indexed content to check whether anything new has been updated on your website or not. But this process consumes a lot of your server resource and bandwidth.

You can know more about it [here](http://www.feedthebot.com/ifmodified.html).

= Before reading any further =

Before reading any further it is important to understand this plugin uses output buffering, in fact the Etag sent by this plugin is a hash of the sites buffered content. If your site uses server side caching this plugin may break the caching functionality. Therefore I suggest that you please **make sure** you have studied the FAQ, before installation and activation. 

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

**Will this plugin cause problem if you use server side caching?**

Quite possibly depending on your setup. It could prevent caching or even break your site if you are using server side caching (including Varnish). This plugin should NOT be used on hosts like WPEngine or DreamPress as it will break caching.

**How do I check if it is working?**

Install one of the the view live HTTP headers tools in your browser. Visit your website and then refresh the page. On your second visit the website should return a 304 not modified response.

**Are there other reason why a 304 header is not being return when I haven't changed the content?**

In order to to return 304 the hash of the returned content must be the same (IE the html must be identical between requests.
Unfortunately, some plugin adding dynamic and varying content to each page output returned. Try disabling each plugins to find the culprit.

**What are the benefits?**

This helps visitors and search engines. If your page or post has not been updated since the last visit, then your page will sent a `304 Not Modified Header`. On receipt of this header search engines know nothing has changed (and therefore there is no need to re crawl your site), likewise a normal visitors browser will get a 304 and will use the browser side cache of the page (thus speeding up the visitors experience).


== Installation ==
